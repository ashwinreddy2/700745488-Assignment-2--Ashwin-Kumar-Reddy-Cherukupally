1. Write a program that takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to
fullname function that should return the (full name).
o For example:
▪ First_name = “your first name”, last_name = “your last name”
▪ Full_name = “your full name”
o Write function named “string_alternative” that returns every other char in the full_name string.
Str = “Good evening”
Output: Go vnn
Note: You need to create a function named “string_alternative” for this program and call it from
main function.

A)first we need to enter the first name and last name in the form of strings then we need to define a function and concatinate the two strings first name and the last name and return it..
create a function string alternative to slice the given fullname and then print the output.

2) Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output.
o Finally store the output in output.txt file

A)create a text file and name it as input.txt which contains some text lines in it.
create a function count_word and input the data of input.txt file into a variable file1.
read the data form input.txt using read line funcitons and store the data into info variable.
To store the output create a file output.txt and store the data in the variable file 2.
use the dictioinary variable  to store the key value pairs.
Nested for loop is employed to read the data that has been sotred in the variable info and then count is printed accordingly.


3)Write a program, which reads heights (inches.) customers into a list and convert these heights to
centimeters in a separate list using:
1) Nested Interactive loop.
2) List comprehensions
create a list and name it as inches.
read the values of the list and store it in variable z.
use append function to add the data to z variable.
use while loop until z is null.
perform itereation by incrementing i.
if else conditon is used evaluate unti the condtion z is equalls to null is satisfied.
create  a variable centimeter and calculate the centimeters value using the formula i*2.54 and finally print the output.
